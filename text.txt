 As a rule, we only order some music while sitting at the table 
 Basically, accordingly, these are either evenings during family time, or weekends during dinner 
 in the living room it is located near the kitchen 
 If I was playing before, having fun, I was wondering how well she could talk. 
 For example, I remember playing cities with her... 
 Maybe my brothers and I played a little, but somehow, you know, when there are some functions, I used them a couple of times, I got tired of it all very quickly, and you stop using it. 
 I bought some gadget, you sit and poke, see what new functions are new, poke and poke at something, in the end you use the phone, some couple of applications and an alarm clock. 
 For me, the main thing is to have an assistant like Google Assistant, that is, he doesn’t talk to you, he just carries out tasks. 
 Int.: good, do any of the other people who live with you use the voice assistant? Info: No, because the laptop is mine
 They are located within my workplace, she is always there 
 Well, since it’s a smartphone, it’s usually always with me. 
 He constantly moves, but periodically ends up somewhere far from me 
 For me, the main thing is to have an assistant like Google Assistant, that is, he doesn’t talk to you, he just carries out tasks. 
 Okay, does anyone else who lives with you use this column? Inf.: Yes, in most cases these are children, brothers. 
 therefore, they are used most often by older people: four people. That is, those who are already quite mature, who already have their own formed personalities and their own needs 
 At the level of ideas, this is good, but for now, at least Russian-speaking assistants are too poorly suited for this. That is, the dialogue breaks off quite quickly because the resources that the developers have put in are running out. 
 Actually, well, that is, you understand that she doesn’t follow the flow of dialogue well, her jokes are repeated, that is, this is not a person. 
 She basically fixed one person, and our interest has waned; she does not meet the requirements in terms of intelligence declared on the market. 
 No, the whole concept seems rather strange to me. If communication is not just for fun for five minutes, it’s quite difficult for me to imagine. 
 I consider this a kind of act of schizophrenia. I am not such a lonely person as to purposefully chat and ask 
 No, I’m not interested in communicating with a robot. That is, you don’t get any emotional response. 
 In general, not a single correct answer, you already get used to it. 
 We don’t shout obscenities at the assistant, because in life we don’t shout obscenities. If you are used to thanking for help, this is what you thank. 
 Well, with a person, of course, it’s more interesting, but she and I usually exchange compliments 
 Well, I still feel like real communication is transferred to the column rather than the other way around 
 I saythank you andplease to him. And he saysyou’re welcome. 
 I think it’s just nice to hear good words 
 It's funny, it's so cute. 
 Shut up. After that, she began to be offended, well, and, of course, she went much further on an erotic journey. 
 I'm not kidding, she is really the only creature that can be commanded... 
 Alice, turn on the light, that is, this is some kind of short interaction regarding the light.Alice, change the brightness,Alice, turn off the bright light in 30 minutes, and so on. 
 It seems to me that this is pointless. That is, it can be done, but this is an additional resource. You want to turn on the light, a quick simple action, but when you say:Alice, please turn on the light, thank you, then it’s not so simple and quick action. 
 But the robot is designed to simply, without question, do what it is told 
 Well, most likely I can say that every day, but not for long. Well, either turn on some selection of music to suit your mood, maybe some kind of playlist, and it plays for several hours, and that’s it. 
 I would say, if you take on average, music, maybe once a day, calls once or twice a day, I don’t know how to calculate, it’s always so different 
 From the point of view of money, we are not very interested, because I kind of use it once or twice. 
 Honestly, it seems to me that it’s only music and calls, so it’s somehow difficult for me to use it more often 
 I use it in the morning to turn on music while doing sports 
 Well, most often it is used for listening to music 
 Well, maybe you can check the weather, but that’s pretty little 
 I can ask what the weather is like 
 I can ask the weather if I’m too lazy to climb. 
 Well, first of all, let’s say you’re sitting in a group of people, some stupid question: who? When was he born? or something else? What celebrity? Where was he filmed? 
 Then, let’s say, find out some recipe, interesting facts 
 As for the choice, I use Alice not just for communication, for a smart home, a light bulb, and accordingly the choice is determined by the fact that I need to turn on the light. 
 Usually in the evening and at night, when you need light by the bed 
 That is, I conduct some kind of educational activity, or when friends come, I can turn on some selection of music. So, most often I use it in such cases. 
 Because that's where I spend most of my time. When I'm working, she plays music. So it's actually near my workspace, which is what I use. 
 Well, if there’s an alarm clock, then I won’t because it’s inconvenient from the point of view that she’s standing in another room, and if you set the alarm clock, then you’re guaranteed to come over. 
 They can, of course, ask to play some music, but most often they just play around with her, call her names, which I have seen more than once, look at her reaction, and send her somewhere a second time. Therefore, most often they ask to tell some kind of joke, but again, ordinary children's affairs
 Children can use her to talk to her 
 ...there were also such cases, for example, when the device was disconnected from the Internet, and the assistant could not do anything. 
 ...suddenly turned off, it stopped working, I had to connect again. 
 Another difficulty is when you rephrase the question a little, and the assistant just starts opening the search and doesn’t understand. 
 There are also some voice commands to which it responds, but I don’t remember what is there, the problem arises at the stage of forming a competent request, sometimes the search is really structured very competently. 
 Well, yes, you need to remember them, be able to handle them. I assume that not every person can withstand all this. 
 Int.: Have you encountered situations when the device simply did not respond to a question? Inf.: Yes, it happened.
 It used to happen, since she doesn’t stand that close to the sofa, from time to time she simply doesn’t hear 
 There are periodic problems with understanding, especially English speech 
 she doesn’t always understand correctly what I say 
 More often it just acts as an irritant. It just turns on at the wrong time in the wrong place and ruins something 
 Yes they were. I don’t remember under what circumstances, it just happened that she had to be shut up. 
 Sometimes the easiest way is to just not ask her. 
 I simply turned it off, roughly shut it up, and looked for it myself. This, of course, didn’t happen often, but it happened, let’s put it this way 
 Most often the easiest way is to stand up and do it with your hands 
 I think I expressed some kind of dissatisfaction even with obscenities, it was just an expression of dissatisfaction. 
 Nothing, it just dawns on me after a while, after two or three times, that he doesn’t answer and the sound doesn’t turn on, I turn it on and she starts talking. 
  Do you repeat the same thing to him directly several times? -Yes, I had this happen 
 I saysound five, that is, well, in principle, a fairly understandable command. But every time this story happens: instead of switching to the desired sound, she starts babbling something there, annoying this moment until then...  
 It's annoying. 
 Well, then periodic failure to respond to a request is also annoying 
 I was slightly irritated when I couldn’t ask him to translate something in two languages 
 ...this moment irritates you until you get used to the peculiarities, to some kind of human spontaneity, or something... 
 I can't say I'm angry, none of that. I can’t say that it’s some kind of negative feeling. quicker.Eh, okay, let’s do it again. 
 Well, probably neutral emotions 
 Rather, it depends on the mood. If I’m already tired and come from somewhere from school, from work, she somehow starts to bring a blizzard, and again goes on an erotic journey further away. 
 If I was playing before, having fun, I was wondering how well she could talk. 
 ...I used to go into it once every few months. Play cities with friends, relatively speaking
 It was fun to just take time, spend it with friends.
 Rather, when someone comes, I show her what she can do, what a fun toy looks like...
We quoted her there, recognized the voice, this game, but she could not identify the voices of 2 female voices.
 For me, the main thing is to have an assistant like Google Assistant, that is, he doesn’t talk to you, he just carries out tasks.
